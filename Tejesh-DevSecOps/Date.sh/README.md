🕒 Print Current Date in a Loop
This Bash script prints the current date and time 10 times, with a 1-second delay between each output. It's a simple demonstration of using loops, the date command, and basic text processing with awk.

🔧 What It Does
Loops from 1 to 10.
Prints the current date and time (e.g., Mon Jun 17 10:43:21).
Formats the output using awk to show only the first four fields.
Delays 1 second between each print using sleep 1.

✅ Prerequisites
Unix/Linux environment with Bash
awk and date commands available (typically pre-installed)

▶️ How to Run
Save the script to a file, e.g., date_loop.sh
Make it executable:
chmod 700 filename or chmod +x filename
or use "bash filename"
